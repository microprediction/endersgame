# Prize Pool Distribution Example

The prize pool will be split among the top ten profit scores in proportion to the profit. Here's an example of how that works:

## Scenario

- Total prize pool: $10,000
- Top 10 participants and their respective profits:
  1. **Alice**: $2,000 profit
  2. **Bob**: $1,500 profit
  3. **Charlie**: $1,200 profit
  4. **David**: $1,000 profit
  5. **Eve**: $800 profit
  6. **Frank**: $700 profit
  7. **Grace**: $600 profit
  8. **Heidi**: $500 profit
  9. **Ivan**: $400 profit
  10. **Judy**: $300 profit

### Step 1: Calculate total profit for the top 10
The total profit for the top 10 participants is:
$$
2000 + 1500 + 1200 + 1000 + 800 + 700 + 600 + 500 + 400 + 300 = 9000
$$

### Step 2: Determine each participant's proportion of the total profit
Each participant's share of the prize pool is proportional to their profit. For example, Aliceâ€™s share is:
$$
\text{Alice's proportion} = \frac{2000}{9000} = 0.2222
$$

### Step 3: Calculate each participant's prize
To determine Alice's share of the $10,000 prize pool, multiply her proportion by the total prize:
$$
\text{Alice's prize} = 0.2222 \times 10000 = 2222.22
$$

Similarly, for Bob:
$$
\text{Bob's proportion} = \frac{1500}{9000} = 0.1667
$$
$$
\text{Bob's prize} = 0.1667 \times 10000 = 1666.67
$$

### Step 4: Repeat for all participants
Following the same process for each participant, we get the following prize distribution:

| Participant | Profit | Proportion of Total Profit | Prize   |
|-------------|--------|----------------------------|---------|
| Alice       | $2,000 | 22.22%                     | $2,222.22 |
| Bob         | $1,500 | 16.67%                     | $1,666.67 |
| Charlie     | $1,200 | 13.33%                     | $1,333.33 |
| David       | $1,000 | 11.11%                     | $1,111.11 |
| Eve         | $800   | 8.89%                      | $888.89   |
| Frank       | $700   | 7.78%                      | $777.78   |
| Grace       | $600   | 6.67%                      | $666.67   |
| Heidi       | $500   | 5.56%                      | $555.56   |
| Ivan        | $400   | 4.44%                      | $444.44   |
| Judy        | $300   | 3.33%                      | $333.33   |

### Summary
The prize pool is distributed in direct proportion to each participant's profit. The higher the profit, the larger the share of the prize pool they receive.
