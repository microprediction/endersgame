### About
This package is intended to make life simpler for those participating in an ongoing tournament at [CrunchDAO.com](https://www.crunchdao.com), although it hopefully has independent interest. For instance, you might build on `Attacker` or examples herein to help find signal in your model residuals.  

 - Standalone colab [notebooks](https://github.com/microprediction/endersnotebooks) demonstrating `Attacker` class independently of the contest. 
 - See the README in [attacker.md](https://github.com/microprediction/endersgame/blob/main/endersgame/attackers/attacker.md).  
 - It's also highly recommended to read the [FAQ.md](https://github.com/microprediction/endersgame/blob/main/endersgame/attackers/FAQ.md).
