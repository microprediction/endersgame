Need help tracking things? That's what these classes are for but you are not obligated to use them! 

- Tracking actual trades. See [Pnl](https://github.com/microprediction/midone/blob/main/midone/accounting/pnl.md).
- Tracking hypothetical trades can help you create a [calibrated attacker](https://github.com/microprediction/midone/blob/main/midone/attackers/calibratedattacker.md).  See [SignalPnl](https://github.com/microprediction/midone/blob/main/midone/accounting/SignalPnl.md) docs.
