Think about the workflow for the participant

### Steps

- Write an attacker (colab notebook)
- Run sequentially against 1 live stream
- View statistics
- View visualizations (maybe gamified)
- Run against 100 live streams 

Save down the notebook and upload it. 

### Nice to have

- Run against history
